# TransLang

My new tkinter application . Which could be used to to translate text from one language to other.

THis Appication uses googletrans API for translation

All supported languages ar provided in lang.json file .

With this you can translate upto 15000 Characters per day from any language to any language.Bingo !

Head over the path for the installation.


Steps to use:

1. Write the content you want to translate in the upper box.
2. Type the language in which the content is written in the very left 'From' feild.
3. In the very right corner type the language in which you wanted your text to be converted.
4. Now , just press the translate button in the middle . it may take atleast 1-1.5 second to translate and yeild the result,but it also depends over the size of content you right.
5. After a speculated time have a look over the botton box in which your result is shown.

Now we provide an extra option if you wanted to export the resultant text. To export follow the steps below:

1. Click on the export button over the right corner.(Save as dialog would appear).
2. select the file type and click save button.

The file would be exported to the selected path.

Thats all to say,

Thank you,
